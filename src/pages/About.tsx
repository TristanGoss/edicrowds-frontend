          <h1 className="page-title">About Edinburgh Crowds</h1>
          <p className="text-block">
            Edinburgh Crowds is a solo project by {' '}<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tristan-goss" className="no-wrap-link">Tristan Goss</a>,
            a Software Engineer specialising in sensor data processing.
            It is intended to act as a personal portfolio entry and (hopefully) a minor income source.
          </p>
          <p className="text-block">
            The project is mostly open source, with all open-source components released under the GPLv3 license. The open-source repositories are
            {' '}<a href="https://github.com/TristanGoss/edicrowds-frontend" className="no-wrap-link">edicrowds-frontend</a> and 
            {' '}<a href="https://github.com/TristanGoss/edicrowds-backend" className="no-wrap-link">edicrowds-backend</a>.
            The data warehouse, nowcasting algorithm and possibly some input processors will be closed source.
            The edicrowds-backend repo can be used without these, but it will return dummy nowcasts.
          </p>
          <h2 className="section-title">Who is this for?</h2>
          <p className="text-block">
            Edinburgh Crowds is primarily for Tourists visiting Edinburgh who would like to avoid the substantial crowds within the city.
            As the service matures, it may pick up other customers in terms of Edinburgh residents, researchers, companies and other third parties who would
            like access to the data warehouse.
          </p>
          <h2 className="section-title">Competing services</h2>
          <p className="text-block">
            The main alternative to Edinburgh Crowds is Google Maps.
            Google Maps <a href ="https://support.google.com/maps/answer/11323117?hl=en" target="_blank" className="no-wrap-link">offers warnings</a> of when an area is more busy or less busy than usual,
            and shows patterns of busyness for individual addresses and even public transport infrastructure.
          </p>
          <p className="text-block">
            Google Maps does not provide an absolute metric (only relative busyness), relies entirely on mobile phone trajectory
            data, and provides the overall busyness of an area (including people indoors and in vehicles) rather than specifically pedestrian density.
          </p>
          <p className="text-block">
            Edinburgh Crowds provides a substantively different metric to Google. Further, we also plan to incorporate the shedules of Theatres, Stadiums,
            Concert halls and other events that have a dramatic impact on how crowded certain areas of the city are, rather than relying purely on sensor data.
            For these reasons, we believe Edinburgh Crowds can improve upon the service offered by Google.
          </p>
          <h2 className="section-title">Monetisation</h2>
          <p className="text-block">
            We plan to offer nowcasts for free. Customers must purchase forecasts and access to historical data for Â£2.49 for one week of access.
            We believe this will result in a service that pays for its own hosting, and returns a minor supplimentary income to the author.
            Monetisation is not a priority for the project, so will be added after the service is functional and its output verified.
